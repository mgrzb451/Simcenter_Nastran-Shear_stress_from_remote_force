# Simulation Setup
Employing RBE3 interpolated elements to transfer remote Force onto prepared edges of the shaft

# Result and Conclusion
The ~6% discrepancy in resultant shear stress value between the manual calculations and the analysis most likely stems from the differences in applied constraints, which are not included in the textbook problem but are present in the FEA
